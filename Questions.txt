Questions:

1. How long is the presentation?
    - 15 mins.
2. What do you expect to be presented in the presentation?
    - explian the capabilities!
    - examples of stuff that goes through verification!
    - features
    - challenges + solutions
    - unsolved stuff, thigs that don't work
3. More of a focus on the final product? More on the journey?
    - final product
4. Do we submit our code somewhere?
    - read me 
5. Should we show some examples?  
    - yes

6. WLP of while that we did (1st & 2nd)
    - find paper on wlp of while

7. date set up
    - email. 

Extra notes:
- note: Z3 can build const. (or קבועות בחלקים) functions, has trouble solving more complex functions for infinite models.
- our forall is still helpful: can help with BOUNDED MODEL CHECKING.
- optional: f(1) --> @f__1 (easier computation for z3)

TO DO:
* make the verification more readable
* send email to schedule presentation time (29 or 30 in oct)
* look up papers about wlp and loops?
* README: how to write code, how to run Verification, how to read results
* options for MAIN: print pre-process result, print details of all verification conditions, if YES pre-process: print temp-variables after pre-process.
* explain WHY the invariant fails verification: PRINT: P->inv fails OR {b&&inv} c; {inv} fails.
* explain why 1st auto-inv is weak + examples
* "loops are bad": add old VCs more clearly
* when cannot verify, returns line or lines of problem origin. why can it be from more than a single line? 
 NOTE: code already fixed, required changing IF wlp. ADD TO PRESENTATION

FORALL
optional change:
* no free variables
* global for functions
